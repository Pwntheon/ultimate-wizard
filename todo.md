1. Extract a "purchase" component. This should:
 * Check if you can afford. Disabled button if not
 * When you buy, sub the appropriate resource(s) and add what you bought
 * Would probably need a separate "resources" file with costs, creep, etc.

3. Make layout

4. Extend buy button to support some modifier button for buying 100%/50% etc. of what you can afford.
 * Show price and return on button when modifier button is held
