1. Make layout

2. Extend buy button to support some modifier button for buying 100%/50% etc. of what you can afford.
 * Show price and return on button when modifier button is held

3. Create panel component that can contain list of resources. We probably want one for population, one for economy and one for magic for now

4. Create simple tooltip to show costs for buyables & spells

5. Clean up spells handling

6. Figure out the similarities and differences between spells and purchases, especially in the buttons, and clean up. Some code can maybe be reused

7. Show income per second/minute/hour on resources, depending on a setting. Tooltip for now, maybe popper or styled suffix later
