# Ultimate Wizard

## Concept
You are a fledgling wizard just setting out into the world to make your mark. You find a crystal formation in the wild which lets you gather mana. Using your powers (magical and mundane) you gather followers, resources and magical energies in order to build a grand wizard tower, which allows you to research the most powerful of spells.

In the process you will seek out stronger foci than your starting crystal, places where you can start a new settlement with even more power and potential

## Genre
An incremental game with no spam clicking needed. A balance of infinite resources (food, gold, etc.) and limited ones (mana, others). First prestiege mechanic is searching for more powerful foci to build your settlement around

## Gameplay
Typical incremental game.
You start attracting a few followers, then with their help (and magic) improve your settlement so that you can:
 * Start using followers to help you gather mana, research spells, etc.
 * Build a more suitable abode for a powerful wizard

After a while you can start looking for a better focus. You can move to one of these and start the settlement anew, but with stronger powers this time. Later resources are locked behind different kinds of foci, but to find these require a powerful wizard indeed.

GUI is web based, with a permanently visible resource view, and different pages for viewing actions, such as settlement, tower, spells etc.

## Resources
### Basic resources
These work pretty simply. For instance farmers who will gather food over time. Limitless storage. Different upgrades can make the gathering process more efficient.

Some of these are required to sustain your settlement. As you unlock more powerful upgrades, less of your followers need to work to sustain the settlement itself, leaving them free to work on helping you directly.

### Mana
Some mana is generated over time by your local Focus. Different upgrades and followers can improve the generation rate. Better foci gives a higher base gain.

Relatively low cap, which can be improved somewhat. Spells can be set as autocast, which will cause them to be cast once mana reaches max, so you don't lose out on generation. This should ideally work offline too.

### Entropy
Powerful reality altering spells will increase local entropy. A powerful wizard can negate some of these effects, up to a certain point.

In effect, you can cast spells which linger, giving you some bonus until they are turned off. You have a soft cap to how many you can control at one time. Implement this first as a hard cap, but eventually it should be possible to go over this cap, with some harsh penalties.

Managing which spells to spend your entropy on is a core mechanic which rewards players who can analyze and adapt to the situation at hand.
